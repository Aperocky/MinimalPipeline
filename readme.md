## Pipeline

This is a pipeline framework designed to start modularized tasks independently while maintaining the flow of the data.

Instead of a master control script to start tasks, each task will behave as its own master process working in tandem with other jobs.

This pipeline is designed to be minimally viable - able to complete the design criteria without being intrusive or overly complicated in any way. And it tries to allow for maximum freedom for individual tasks to be carried out.
